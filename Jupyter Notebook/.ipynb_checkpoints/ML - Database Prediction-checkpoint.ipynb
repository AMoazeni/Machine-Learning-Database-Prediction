    "Let's take a look at the theory behind the Artificial Neural Network algorithm which was popularized by Geoffrey Hinton in the 1980's and is used in Deep Machine Learning. \"Deep\" in Deep Learning refers to all the hidden layers used in this type of Dynamic Programming algorithm.\n",

    "The input layer observations and related output refer to ONE row of data. Adjustment of weights is how Neural Nets learn, they decide the strength and importance of signals that are passed along or blocked by an Activation Function. They keep adjusting weights until the predicted output closely matches the actual output.\n",
